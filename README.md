## Jupyter Notebook Installation

- For this workshop I recommend using one of the 2 online platforms for working with Jupyter Noteboks:
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), a cloud platform for hosting Jupyter Notebooks. You need to have a Google account, but it does not require any local installations.
  - [Kaggle Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code), a platform for sharing and exploring data-science-focussed Jupyter Notebooks. Although technically owned by Google, you can register just for Kaggle website.
- If you would prefer to install Jupyter Notebook on your local machine, there are two main ways to do this: [pip](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip) and [conda](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda). Unless you have prior experience with Python, I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution, which contains all the packages required for this course.
