## Jupyter Notebook Installation

- There are two main ways to install Jupyter Notebook: [pip](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip) and [conda](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda). Unless you have prior experience with Python, I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution, which contains all the packages required for this course.
- Alternatively, you may choose to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), a cloud platform for hosting Jupyter Notebooks. Its interface is slightly different and you need to have a Google account, but it does not require any local installations.
